National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)
=========================================

The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete
collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the
United States and a growing list of international locations for 1998-2017. The
NSRDB provides foundational information to support U.S. Department of Energy
programs, research, and the general public.

The NSRDB provides time-series data at 30 minute resolution of resource
averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude,
or nominally 4 km in size. The solar radiation values represent the resource
available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties
which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x)
algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin. Fast all-sky radiation
model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties,
and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from
ancillary source are used to estimate solar irradiance (GHI, DNI, and DHI).
The Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is computed for clear skies using the
REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, FARMS is used to
compute GHI. The Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) for cloud scenes is then
computed using the DISC model. The PATMOS-X model uses half-hourly radiance
images in visible and infrared channels from the GOES series of geostationary
weather satellites.  Ancillary variables needed to run REST2 and FARMS (e.g.,
aerosol optical depth, precipitable water vapor, and albedo) are derived from
the the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. Temperature and
wind speed data are also derived from MERRA-2 and provided for use in SAM to
compute PV generation.

The following variables are provided by the NSRDB:

- Irradiance:

    - Global Horizontal (ghi)
    - Direct Normal (dni)
    - Diffuse (dhi)

- Clear-sky Irradiance
- Cloud Type
- Dew Point
- Temperature
- Surface Albedo
- Pressure
- Relative Humidity
- Solar Zenith Angle
- Precipitable Water
- Wind Direction
- Wind Speed
- Fill Flag
- Angstrom wavelength exponent (alpha)
- Aerosol optical depth (aod)
- Aerosol asymmetry parameter (asymmetry)
- Cloud optical depth (cld_opd_dcomp)
- Cloud effective radius (cld_ref_dcomp)
- cloud_press_acha
- Reduced ozone vertical pathlength (ozone)
- Aerosol single-scatter albedo (ssa)


Data Format
-----------

The data is provided in high density data file (.h5) separated by year. The
variables mentioned above are provided in 2 dimensional time-series arrays
with dimensions (time x location). The temporal axis is defined by the
``time_index`` dataset, while the positional axis is defined by the ``meta``
dataset. For storage efficiency each variable has been scaled and stored as an
integer. The scale-factor is provided in the ``psm_scale-factor`` attribute.
The units for the variable data is also provided as an attribute
(``psm_units``).

NSRDB Module
------------

An extraction utility for the NSRDB has been created with in `reVX <https://github.com/nrel/reVX>`_ and is available on Eagle as a module:

.. code-block:: bash

    module use /datasets/modulefiles
    module load NSRDB

The NSRDB module provides a `NSRDB <https://nrel.github.io/reVX/reVX/reVX.resource.solar_cli.html#nsrdb>`_ command line utility with the following options and commands:

.. code-block:: bash
