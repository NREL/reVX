        save_paths : bool, optional
            Flag to save reinforcement line path as a multi-line
            geometry. By default, ``False``.
        length_invariant_cost_layers : List[str] | None, optional
            List of layers in H5 to be added to the 'base' greenfield
            cost raster. The costs specified by these layers are not
            scaled with distance traversed across the cell (i.e. fixed
            one-time costs for crossing these cells).
        tracked_layers : dict, optional
            Dictionary mapping layer names to strings, where the strings
            are numpy methods that should be applied to the layer along
            the LCP. For example,
            ``tracked_layers={'layer_1': 'mean', 'layer_2': 'max}``
            would report the average of ``layer_1`` values along the
            least cost path and the max of ``layer_2`` values along the
            least cost path. Examples of numpy methods (non-exhaustive):

                - mean
                - max
                - min
                - mode
                - median
                - std

            By default, ``None``, which does not track any extra layers.
        ss_id_col : str, default="poi_gid"
            Name of column containing unique identifier for each
            substation. This column will be used to compute minimum
            reinforcement cost per substation.
            By default, ``"poi_gid"``.
